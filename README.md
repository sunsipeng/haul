## Features

**Open:** Haul is a drop-in replacement for `react-native` CLI built on open tools like Webpack.

**Hackable:** Provides a familiar environment by leveraging the Webpack ecosystem.

**Just works:** Built on top of battle tested open source projects, so you never hit annoying issues like symlink support. 

**Helpful:** Designed from the ground up with helpful error messages to increase your productivity.

## Getting started

Start by adding Haul as a dependency to your project:

```bash
yarn add --dev haul-cli
```

To configure your project to use haul, run the following:

```bash
yarn run haul init
```

This will automatically add the configuration needed to make Haul work with your app, e.g. add `webpack.haul.js` to your project, which you can customise to add more functionality.

Finally, start the development server:

```bash
yarn run haul start -- --platform ios
```

Now you are ready to start!

## Documentation

Check out the docs to learn more about available commands and tips on customizing the webpack configuration.

## Limitations

Haul uses a completely different architecture from React Native packager, which means there are some things which don't work quite the same.

We are actively working on adding support for the following:

- Existing `react-native` commands 
- React DevTools
- Developer menu -> Start systrace

The following features are **unlikely to be supported** in the future:

- Developer menu -> Enable Hot Reloading: use `webpack.haul.js` config instead
- Haste module system: use something like [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) instead
- Transpile files under `node_modules`: transpile your modules before publishing, or configure webpack not to ignore them
